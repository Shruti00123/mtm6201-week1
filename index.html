                My name is Shruti Sood. I am from India. I did graduation in Commerce but I always wanted to do a design
                program and thus I decided to choose this program and follow my interests and passion. I really like art
                and creativity. I also like to play badminton. During my high school time, I was a good badminton
                player. I love travelling a lot. It's my dream to travel the world. I really like visiting historical
                places and know about their histories. I want to visit historical places of every country. I loved to
                spend time with my dog when I was in India. It's my dream to build shelters one day for the stray
                animals in IndiaI I also like music and would love to learn guitar one day.

                I am also working part-time along with my studies to pay for my expenses of living here as being an
                international student, expenses and other costs are very important to manage and I make budget every
                month for myself.
